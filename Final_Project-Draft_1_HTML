#Ivan: Adding optional import for a CSS and a PHP file here shortly. We'll have three files, this one for HTML, one for CSS and one for PHP headers / footers.

    <title> TITLE PLACEHOLDER </title>

#Ivan: Added a space for a branded favicon
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="///">
</head>

#Ensure we separate our HTML and our CSS. File management is much easier and more organized this way.
